**Fowl Play** is a mod that aims to improve Minecraft's ambience and make the world seem more alive, adding birds with realistic behaviours, sounds, and flying mechanics

Far from fluttering parrots and chickens, Fowl Play's birds can all take to the skies, be it hawks soaring majestically or sparrows darting between trees

Some birds provide much-needed ambience to forests, others can be tamed to help players, and all of them interact to create a living ecosystem!
