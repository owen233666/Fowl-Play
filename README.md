# Fowl Play

Fowl Play adds more birds to Minecraft, with realistic behaviours, sounds, and flying mechanics. Unlike fluttering parrots and chickens, Fowl Play's birds can all take to the skies gracefully (_except flightless birds_). Some of them add ambience, others have useful features and all of them try to annoy you as much as they can!
